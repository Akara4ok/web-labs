                    <b>Board games</b> are tabletop games that typically use
                    pieces moved or placed on a pre-marked board (playing
                    surface) and often include elements of table, card,
                    role-playing, and miniatures games as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most feature a competition between two or more players. In
                    checkers, a player wins by capturing all opposing pieces,
                    while Eurogames often end with a calculation of final
                    scores. Pandemic is a cooperative game where players all win
                    or lose as a team, and peg solitaire is a puzzle for one
                    person.
                </p>

                    There are many varieties of board games. Their
                    representation of real-life situations can range from having
                    no inherent theme, such as checkers, to having a specific
                    theme and narrative, such as Cluedo. Rules can range from
                    the very simple, such as in Snakes and Ladders; to deeply
                    complex, as in Advanced Squad Leader.

                    The time required to learn to play or master a game varies
                    greatly from game to game, but is not necessarily correlated
                    with the number or complexity of rules; games like chess or
                    Go possess relatively simple rulesets, but have great
                    strategic depth.
