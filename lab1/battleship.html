              <b>Board games</b> are tabletop games that typically use pieces
              moved or placed on a pre-marked board (playing surface) and often
              include elements of table, card, role-playing, and miniatures
              games as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most feature a competition between two or more players. In
              checkers, a player wins by capturing all opposing pieces, while
              Eurogames often end with a calculation of final scores. Pandemic
              is a cooperative game where players all win or lose as a team, and
              peg solitaire is a puzzle for one person.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are many varieties of board games. Their representation of
              real-life situations can range from having no inherent theme, such
              as checkers, to having a specific theme and narrative, such as
              Cluedo. Rules can range from the very simple, such as in Snakes
              and Ladders; to deeply complex, as in Advanced Squad Leader.
            </p>
            <p>
              The time required to learn to play or master a game varies greatly
              from game to game, but is not necessarily correlated with the
              number or complexity of rules; games like chess or Go possess
              relatively simple rulesets, but have great strategic depth.
